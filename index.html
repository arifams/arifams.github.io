<h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"></a>Hi my name is Arif</h3>
<p>
<img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/14273443?v=3&amp;s=460" alt="" width="150" height="150" style="float: left; padding: 0 10px 10px 0" />
                        I live in Amsterdam and currently own two beautiful gold fish and a harmonica. I love cooking, painting, meditating, coding, and playing ukulele. Oh yeah, I love summer.</p>
<p>I started my career as an art therapist by established a street kids house in 1996. With other care takers we were responsible for approximately 200 local kids and 30 volunteers on a daily basis program. We were helping the street kids to overcome their abusive trauma with an art class. It were really busy days but also some of the most awesome years in my life, unfortunately due to the local political situation we could only do it for 3 years.</p>
<p>After that I became a teacher, marine, app developer, animator, model, skateboarder, and even a model. During this time, cooking became one of my favourite hobby's. I took my cooking hobby to another level by opening a small shop to provide breakfast and lunch. One of my best seller dishes was coconut rice with soy sauce tofu stew. In 2002, my shop had 250 clients for breakfast and it's double during the lunch time.</p>
<p>Then, I decide to travel around the world.</p>
<p>After I'm done with my chef education and JavaScript/Ruby training, I do some travel again to visit the kitchens of my friends and family, to learn the wisdom from their kitchen. At the same time I am building an app to collect traditional and local recipes. You can read about it further in my Project section. Anyway, welcome to my site :) </p>
