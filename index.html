<h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"></a>Hi my name is Arif</h3>
<p>I live in Amsterdam&nbsp;and I currently&nbsp;own two beautiful gold fish and a harmonica. I love cooking, painting, meditating, coding, and play ukulele. Oh yeah, I love summer.</p>
<p>I started my career as an art therapist&nbsp;by&nbsp;working and building a street kids house in 1996. With other care taker we were responsible for approximately 200 local kids and 30 volunteers on their daily basis program.We were helping the street kids to overcome their abusive trauma with an art class. It was really busy days but indeed some of most awesome&nbsp;years in my life, unfortunately due to local political situation we only could do it for 3 years.</p>
<p>After that I become an app developer and 2D animator. During this time, cooking become one of my favourite hobby. But I took my cooking hobby to another level by opening a small tent&nbsp;to provide breakfast and lunch. One of my best seller recipe was coconut rice with soy sauce tofu stew. In 2002,&nbsp;my tent has 250 clients for breakfast and double of that amount during lunch time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, I decide to travel around the world.</p>
<p>After 8 years become developer and designer in a bio technology lab, I decide to go back to school. Since the middle of&nbsp;2016, after I'm done with my chef&nbsp;school and JavaScript/Ruby training, I travel around the world again to visit my friends and family kitchen. To learn the wisdom from their kitchen. Also building an app to collect traditional and local recipe. You can read further in my Project section. Anyway, welcome to my site :)</p>
